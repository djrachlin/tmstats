tmglobals was incepted to solve the problem of passing around lots of
parameters


parms and globals are very closely related -- they both exist because of code
evolution

setup expects a parms instance

tmparms lines 37 - 43 : standard arguments
    -improvement: setup standard arguments (verbose and quiet)

Priority when resolving parameters:
1. The name of the .yml file 
2. Values from the yml file 
3. Non-false values from the command line or defaults in the parser (e.g.
parms.add_argument())
    3.1 For values not in the .yml file, we use the parse value (from the
    command line if specified, or default if not specified)
