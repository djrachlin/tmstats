-In tumutil, the parseWPconfig function accepts a file as an argument.
In one implementation of this function, a file is passed via (open('asdf','r')), 
which leaves the file open. I think that all file handling should be done via
context managers (e.g. with open(filename) as f: do stuff;)

-'globals' is a Python keyword. All usages of 'globals' should be replaced with 'globals_'.
The trailing underscore is a Python convention for re-using a reserved keyword but not 
overloading it.
