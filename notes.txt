==================================================
-In tumutil, the parseWPconfig function accepts a file as an argument.
In one implementation of this function, a file is passed via (open('asdf','r')), 
which leaves the file open. I think that all file handling should be done via
context managers (e.g. with open(filename) as f: do stuff;)

-'globals' is a Python keyword. All usages of 'globals' should be replaced with 'globals_'.
The trailing underscore is a Python convention for re-using a reserved keyword but not 
overloading it.

-Question: In maketrainingpage (and probably other files as well), there is a section where
attributes of parms (an instance of tmparms) are set via the dot syntax, but these attributes
are not defined anywhere in tmparms. Are these attributes just set ad-hoc? For example,
parms.now = xxx; parms.start = xxx; parms.end = xxx;


-In general, it would be nice to replace all string formatting with f-strings for readability


Where does the website reside?
This website is hosted by dreamhost (VPS). Probably Cenos. Do not have root access.
In the dropbox package, all you need to deal with dreamhost is there.

1G storage. Shell account but no root access.

OpenSSL

Every page is a wordpress page. We use a lot of Plugins. Most stuff is stock wordpress.
Everything is a page. 

Feed them social. Runs every 15 minutes

jetpack

metaslide

events calender -- what I amn going to be dealing with

WP Super Cachhe -- not using

Divi is a theme on top of wordpress.


TWO PLUGNS ARE CRITICAL
IncludeME -- lets you include a file with HTML or PHP
does not interpret shortcode in external files

InsertPHP -- lets you add PHP from an external file



tmparms will always promote yml values as if they were arguments passed to the script.
